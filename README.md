# GMIT-Programming-and-Scripting
Exercise 1 and 2
  - Python program to calculate the nth Fibonacci number where n the sum of the first and last letters of your first name,where the     letter is numbered

Exercise 3
  - Python script that starts with an integer and repeatedly applies the Collatz function (divide by 2 if even, multiply by three and 1 if odd) using a while loop and if statement. At each iteration, the current value of the integer should be printed to the screen. You can specify in your code the starting value of 17.

Exercise 4
  -Problem 5 from Project Euler.2,520 is the smallest number that can be divided by each of the numbers from 1 to 10 without any remainder. Write a Python program using for and range to calculate the smallest positive number that is evenly divisible by all of the numbers from 1 to 20.
