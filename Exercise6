# Exercise 6
# script containing a function called factorial() that takes a single input/argument 
# which is a positive integer and returns its factorial
# test the function by calling it with the values 5, 7, and 10

def factorial(n): # create a definition
  x=1 # answer is a positive integer and starts at 1
  while n>=1: # loop through the range of numbers (ie.keeps multiplying) when greater than 0
    x=x*n # start multiplication with the n number
    n=n-1 # reduce the n number each time it goes through the loop
  return x # give result

n=5
print (factorial(n)) # print result of factorial 5

n=7
print (factorial(n))

n=10
print (factorial(n))
